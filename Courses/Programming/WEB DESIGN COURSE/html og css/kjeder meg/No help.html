	<h1>I'm just trying to make a site without any help what so ever.</h1>
	<p>so let's just talk about my life. My life isn't really much to talk about, i'm just a regular guy from norway who stay most of the time inside and play video games like WoW, Overwatch, FIFA etc.
	I dated this girl 2 years ago, it was going very well the first month, then for some reason she decided to go back to her ex. I was sure that she was the one, we were friends since the childhood, and i've kinda always had a thing for her. ANYWAYS, This is my first site were i do all the programming without any help, hope you like it, and leave feedback.</p>
