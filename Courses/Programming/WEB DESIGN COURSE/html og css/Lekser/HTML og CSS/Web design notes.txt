HTML, CSS, JS Notes!      HTML = the nouns of a web page, CSS = the adjectives and JavaScript = the verbs.

Front end = what you see, the HTML, the CSS and the JS. The Back End is what you don't see. The web server, python, php, etc

HTML stand for HyperText Markup Language

HTML = the skeleton of a webpage

HTML defines the structure og a webpage "put an image here" "put a form here"

CSS stand for Cascading Style Sheets and it defines the style of HTML "make all text purple" "give the first image a yellow border"

CSS = the skin of the HTML skeleton

JavaScript adds logic and interactivity to a page like "do some math" "change color when the user clicks" "Load new data from twitter"

The <Head> element is what we do't see on a website like font files, java scripts files. And the <Body> is what we see on the webstie like colors and fonts

<h1> - <h6>. 1 is the most important heading on your page and the largest and number 6 is the least important one

Use <p> </p> when you're writing a paragraph

Use <b> or <Strong> when you want to make a bold text

Use <i> for italic text or <em> for empasize (same result)

If you want to make an ordered list use <ol> (stands for ordered list) and use <li> for the text in the list like this |<ol>		 |You don't need to add numbers like (1.Red) inside the <li> because it gets added automaticaly
														       |   <li>Red</li>  |
														       |   <li>green</li>|					
														       |   <li>blue</li> |
													     	       |</ol>            |
You could also do the same with <ul> to get an unordered list, so you get a * or a black dot instead of numbers. You can also add unordered list inside a order list so you can add what objects have that color

<ol>
   <li>Red
     <ul>
      <li>blood</li>
      <li>red car</li>
     </ul>
     </li>
   <li>Blue
     <ul>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Sky</li>
     </ul>
     </li>
   <li>Green
     <ul>
      <li>Grass</li>
      <li>Boogers</li>
    </ul>
    </li>	

<div> is the generic container for flow content. In other words its just a way to group things together	like this <div>
														  <h1>Wassup</h1>
                                                                                    
                                                                                                                  <p>posdfkopsdkfopwsekgjopskgopsdkgopsjdgposjhopsdgopksdpgoks</p>
                                                                                                                  </div>
So now i can add a colored box around the headline and the paragraph without screwing with my other codes.
											
If i add a div inside a paragraph like this <p>aopsdoapks<div>wassup</div>fopkadopgkodag</p> what i higlighted will seperate into its own line

so instead of a div we can use a span, which looks like this asdaopkfsodfkspodkgpsodg<span>wassup</span>sopfksdopkfoksdopgks

div is a block level element and span is an element that you use in line

To add a source to a page you need to use the element <img src="SOURCE HERE">. There is no closing tag. you can eiter copy a url of a picture on google, or put in a name of a picture you have saved.

to add links you need and anchor tag <a href="www.google.com">write something here to make the link visible</a> and make sure to have "https://" infront of your url

if you want to add another page to your own website that you've created, just add <a href="your textname.html">write what ever you want</a>

<table> is a way to make to display information in a tabular format, and one way of doing this is to put <tr>(tr stands for table row)inside of <table> and inside of <tr> you put a <td>. And to adda border put border="1" inside of <table> so it looks like this. To make another row, just add another <tr>
																																    <table border="1">
																													                                 <tr>
																																         <td>Blue</td>
																																         <td>Red</td>
 																																         </tr>
																																	 <tr>
																																         <td>Yellow</td>
																																	 <td>Green</td>
																																	 </tr>			
																															            </table>
																																	
To get a header on the table, make another <tr> and add <th> (table header) inside of it
You can also add a <thead> and add your <th> inside of it and add <tbody> and add your <tr> inside of it like this
															<table border="1">
															
															<thead>
															   <tr>
														    	     <th>name</th>
															     <th>Age</th>
															   </tr>
															</thead>
															<tbody>
															 <tr>
															   <td>Sander</td>		
															   <td>18</td
															 </tr>
															 <tr>
															   <td>Kevin</td
															   <td>18</td>
															 </tr>
															 </tbody>	
															 </table> 

you can resize images that you add with <img width="50" src="URL">

the <form> tag is what you use to create a box where you can write stuff, like a login page or search for something. and to do that you need to make a <form> tag and put in <input> tags so it looks like this <input type="text" placeholder="username> the "placeholder" is what is written on the box
