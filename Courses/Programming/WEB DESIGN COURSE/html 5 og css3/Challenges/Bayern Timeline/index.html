                    <p>February 27th, 1900. Was the day Bayern Munchen was formed. The story begins with Franz John from berlin, where him and 17 members at Munchen city centre resturant 'Gisela' sat down and filed the document establishing the club.</p>

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>National Success</h3>
                    <p>After Germany won their first international in 1910, the club developed at a fater pace. FC Bayern already had 700 members in 1920 and was, as it is today, the biggest football club in Munich. In 1926 the Reds won the South German championship and the first national title came six years later in 1932. And to this day, Bayern has won 30 Bundesliga titles and 19 DFB-Pokal</p>

                    <p>FC Bayern's won their first european throphy back in 1967. Their next success was in 1974 where they won the next 2 years aswell. That makes bayern one of the few teams in the history to win 3 consecutive european throphies. But Bayern hasn't always played in the Champions League / European Cup. In 1995, Bayern finnished 6th in the Bundesliga, which gave them a spot in the Europa League where they beat Bordeaux in the final. And to this day, Bayern has become one of the most successful teams in the UEFA Champions League. With 6 titles that includes 2 Trebles (one in 2013 and one in 2020)</p>

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i>Sextuple season</h3>
                    <p>In 2019 Bayern where struggeling in the Bundesliga. The coach Niko Kovac was obviously not the right man for the job. Bayern where 4th on the table and things looked bad. The players where not a big fan of the coaching technique off the pitch and the instruction on the pitch. It was so bad that players like Thomas Muller, Jerome Boateng, Javi Martinez, Joshua Kimmich and many other big stars started to train by themselves without Kovac. But finally, on November 3th, after months of disatiscation and fighting between the coach and the players, Niko Kovac decided to resign and let someone else take over. And on July 1st, a guy named Hansi Flick who were the assistant coach for Bayern (and Germany when they won the World Cup in 2014) needed to manage the team while the board where searching for a new coach. In his first match in charge, Bayern defeated Olympiacos 2–0 in the UEFA Champions League group stage on 6 November 2019. After a satisfying spell as interim coach, Bayern announced on 22 December 2019 that Flick will remain manager until the end of season. On 17 April 2021, Flick announced that he had told the club he wanted to leave at the end of the season. He voiced his desire to coach the German national football team, given his previous job as an assistant to present German team manager, Joachim Löw. Flick left Bayern with one of the greatest winning records in modern football history. During his tenure, Bayern lost just seven games and won seven trophies (Bundesliga twice, DFB-Pokal, Champions League, DFL-Supercup, UEFA Supercup, Club World Cup). Bayern went undefeated in the 2019–20 Champions League, the first team in European/Champions League history to lift the trophy with a 100-per-cent win record, and won 23 matches in a row across all competitions between 16 February 2020 and 18 September 2020, a record in German professional football. Flick also coached Bayern to a treble, the second treble in Bayern's history. Flick held one of the highest win rates in football history, winning 83% of his games and helped Bayern average 3.0 goals per game across all competitions. In October 2020, Flick won Europe's Coach of the Year, an award for the best coach in football in the major football leagues of Europe. </p>
